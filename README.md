# Holiday_Assessment

This is an application to track holidays over the years 2020 to 2024.

There is a flowchart in holiday_flowchart.png that displays how I planned out how my code should be executed.

the .gitignore file contains the files to ignore that contain sensitive information: config.py and config.cpython-39.pyc. Remember please change my config_ponce.py file to config.py

The holidays.json file contains a provided list of seven holidays that were used as starter holidays.

In order to run the application, download the files incorporated in this repository and launch the holiday_startercode.py file. This file contains the code that creates the user interface for this assessment

Once you have saved all of your changes within the UI, a list of all the holidays involved are created in a new json file called allHolidays.json
